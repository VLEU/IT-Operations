This guide will assist you with the installation process for Windows 10 versions (All versions from Home to Enterprise (non-LTSB/LTSC) share the same installer).

## 1. Check system requirements
It is very likely that your computer meets the minimum requirements already, but this section has been included for peace of mind, as there are a lot of folks who are running old or very old hardware.

The official system requirements for Windows 10, as provided by Microsoft, are the following:

- Processor:	1 gigahertz (GHz) or faster compatible processor or System on a Chip (SoC)
- RAM: 	1 gigabyte (GB) for 32-bit or 2 GB for 64-bit 
- Hard drive size: 32GB or larger hard disk
- Graphics card:	Compatible with DirectX 9 or later with WDDM 1.0 driver
- Display:	800x600
- Internet Connection:	Internet connectivity is necessary to perform updates and to download and take advantage of some features. 

These requirements may change over time. To see the most recent version of these requirements, please access [Microsoft's Website](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-10-specifications)

## 2. Create USB installation media (if needed)
If you do not already have a Windows 10 installation disk or flash drive, or you simply want to create your own, you can create one by accessing [this link](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10) and clicking on "Download Tool Now".

You will want to use a flash drive to install Windows on your computer, but other options are also possible (CD/DVD ISO File).
