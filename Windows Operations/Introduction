Microsoft Windows (commonly referred to as Windows, or simply abbreviated as "Win") is a group of proprietary (closed-source) operating system families developed and marketed by Microsoft.

The most recent itineration of Windows is currently Windows 11, which was introduced in early October 2021. It is intended to be a successor to Windows 10, which will be supported until 2025 (except LTSB and LTSC versions).
Currently, Windows 10 is still the most widely used Operating System in the Windows family (81% usage share, compared to 2.6% for Windows 11).
