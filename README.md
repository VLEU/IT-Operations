# IT-Operations
This repository aims to serve as a general guide for IT Operations, including (but not limited to) OS installation &amp; Management, Basic Scripting, Problem Solving, etc

## To do:
- [ ] Finish this readme. Make it look real good ;)
- [ ] Basic Windows Operations
- [ ] Basic Linux Operations (which distro? might go with Debian)
- [ ] TBA

The plan is to first create some surface-level info sheets and guides and then dive deeper into specific sections/elements/concepts.
